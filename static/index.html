		<b>Description</b><br/>
    Eyelluminati is a project built to aid patients with Locked-In Syndrome to interact with people
    and their environment. It is designed to be used with a low-cost eye tracking device, such as The Eye Tribe, so that
    LIS patients can interact with it. In addition to the GUI, we have built eyeQuery.js (modeled after jQuery) to allow
    developers to easily enable eye tracking for their web pages.
